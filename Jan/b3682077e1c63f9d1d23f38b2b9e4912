Polokwane Municipality was named the Greenest Municipality in South Africa during an awards event in Bloemfontein yesterday (Tuesday) evening. The city also won the district and provincial chapters of the competition earlier. Matshidiso Mothapo, Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, said in a media release that the panel of adjudicators had spent sufficient time at each participating municipality to ensure adequate coverage of all areas of the competition and that Polokwane was assessed on areas that include Waste Management, Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Water Management, Landscaping, Tree Planting and Beautification, Public Participating and Community Empowerment, Leadership and Institutional Arrangements. The prize money of R3,5 million will be given through funding of infrastructure projects aimed at the protection of the environment. Executive Mayor, Thembi Nkadimeng is quoted to have said that the announcement only gives the municipality more work and pressure to ensure that the status is retained.
