A manhunt is on for the suspect responsible for shooting traffic official Kotelo Tshepi (26) and her mother, Makitla Chileki (62) in Ntoane Village outside Dennilton last night (Sunday). Provincial Police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the incident occurred at approximately 22:00. It is alleged that the suspect entered the house of the women and an argument ensued, resulting in him reportedly shooting them before fleeing the scene, according to Ngoepe. Upon the Police s arrival the two women were found dead in the house with multiple bullet wounds to their bodies. Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect might be Tshepi s boyfriend, Ngoepe said. A green Toyota Tazz which he allegedly used to flee the scene was later found abandoned near a filling station at Siyabuswa, Ngoepe added. The traffic official s service pistol and two magazines with ammunition are also missing, it was learnt. According to information Tshepi was attached to the Groblersdal Traffic Station. The motive behind the killing is still to be determined but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. Anyone with information can contact the investigating officer Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501.
