The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the LIM368 Municipality formed from the former Mookgophong and Modimolle municipalities this morning (Wednesday) requested the Public Protector to probe expenditure to the amount of R684 298 incurred by the former Mookgophong Municipality. Speaker of the LIM368 Municipality, Johan Abrie, filed the request at the office of the Public Protector in the city and was accompanied by Jacques Smalle, DA Provincial Leader, Marlene van Staden, Mayor and Dingaan Motshwene, Chief Whip of LIM368 Municipality. At a media briefing held prior to the request being formally filed, Abrie said the matters to be probed included the suspected irregular purchase of gifts prior to the August 2016 municipal elections to the value of more than R250 000 and the rental of 15-seater minibus taxis at amounts in excess of R120 per kilometre. Other purchases were apparently split into portions to result in waiving of the calling for tenders and only obtaining quotations from seemingly dubious service providers. The Auditor-General s report on the accounts of the former Mookgophong Municipality for the financial year that ended on 30 June 2016, highlighted gross transgressions with regard to unauthorised expenditure in excess of R32 million, fruitless and wasteful expenditure close to R9 million and material impairments of almost R14 million, Abrie said and called on the Public Protector to investigate the matters swiftly and to ensure that decisive action is taken against those found responsible. &nbsp; Story and photo: BARRY VILJOEN &gt;&gt;barryv.observer@gmail.com
