The main water pipeline from the Potgieter Avenue reservoir has been damaged yesterday (Thursday) and it is expected to take some time until supply to areas receiving water from the source is restored. Communications and Marketing Manager of Polokwane Municipality, Matshidiso Mothapo confirmed this afternoon (Friday) that this will affect supply of water in certain areas from Potgieter/Webster streets moving down town, including the Central Business District (CBD). The Potgieter (Avenue) reservoir had to be closed off to allow repairs. The municipality will provide temporary relief through water tankers, Mothapo reported. However, attempts by Polokwane Observer to locate water tankers in the affected areas this afternoon proved futile. In response Mothapo said that the tankers are not stationary but are moving around because most of the consumers in the residential areas are not able to collect water from distribution points at this time of the day. Stationary tankers will be deployed at strategic points after 17:00 today and residents may also collect water from the plant in Ladanna, if they wish, Mothapo advised.
